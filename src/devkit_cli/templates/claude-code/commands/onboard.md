I want to on board this project and contribute as a individual contributor.

can you invoke multiple subagents for exploration on code base on various aspects, then according to the info they send back you can go deep into the repo your self. (should not only reply on the info sugagents give you, should think it as a initial step you need to cross verify their information and explore more details related to the task on your intellegence)

and you can make documets to guide me to onboard this project and guide me how to contribute to it, please make sure to go through all the codes and docs to make sure you understand

you can update the documents as you go, after you done with the documentation to guide me, you should also invoke several agents to do a cross validation on the content of the doc with the code. and you should look at the results from subagents critically to decide if you improve as they said.

this is a hard and complex task to help me onboard to let me able to start contributing, so please dive deep and keep working hard.

the documents should be concise and not cumbersome, and should include necessary details but don't make it cumbersome, please explore all details but for documents writing -- focus on the important stuffs
you can organize your files in a onboarding folder you created.
